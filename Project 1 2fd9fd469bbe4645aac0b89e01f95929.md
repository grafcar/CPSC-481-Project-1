# Project 1

**CPSC 481 - Artificial Intelligence**

**Project 1 - Fall 2023**

In this project, you will work with a team to formulate undergraduate advising for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science as a state-space search problem and use the A* search algorithm to implement a planning tool.

**Project Teams**

This project must be completed in a team of five or six. The instructor will assign teams for this project in Canvas.

See the following sections of the Canvas documentation for instructions on group submission:

- [How do I submit an assignment on behalf of a group?](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-an-assignment-on-behalf-of-a-group/ta-p/294)

**Tasks**

**Collect data**

Use the list of courses from the [CS Core Courses](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/_resources/pdf/course_plan/bs-cs-prerequisite-2023-2024.pdf) PDF file found under *Academic Advising* on the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/) homepage.

You are only responsible for planning the “Lower Division Core”, “Upper Division Core”, “Math Requirements,” and “CS Electives” courses. You are not responsible for planning the details of other courses such as “Science/Math Electives,” “General Education,” or “Graduation Requirement” listed on that page. You may also omit the “MATH xxx” electives, though you should include EGGN 495.

For prerequisites, use both the diagram shown in CS Core Courses as well as the current (2023-2024) University Catalog for the [Computer Science B.S](https://catalog.fullerton.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=80&poid=38156&returnto=11049).

**Formulate the problem**

Use the format from *Section 3.1.1 - Search problems and solutions* in the textbook to formally describe the following goal as a state-space search problem:

Create a semester-by-semester course plan similar to the [CS Course Plan](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/_resources/pdf/course_plan/BS-CS%20Course%20Plan_1p_v.2023-07-11.pdf) PDF file found under *Academic Advising* on the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/) homepage. Include only fall and spring semesters. The plan should take the shortest route to graduation, and should include a maximum academic load of 17 units.

**Define heuristics**

As with any real-world problem (see *Section 3.2.2 - Real-world problems in the textbook*), there are some complications. Absent any other considerations, and without including the other requirements like General Education, an uninformed search algorithm would find that the shortest path to graduation packs several semesters full of nothing but Computer Science courses. Not only is this not a reasonable course load for most students, but it fails to leave space for other required courses.

Define one or more heuristics to create more realistic course plans. These might include defining a “reasonable” number of courses to take, rating the difficulty of various courses, specifying courses to avoid taking in the same semester, or any other method of assigning higher costs to some semester plans than to others.

**Implement the search**

Implement a program in Python to use A* search and the heuristics you have defined to search for an optimal path to graduation. You may wish to begin with the [code from the GitHub repository for the textbook](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/search4e.ipynb). The input should be a set of courses that the student has already completed successfully (for first-time freshmen, this set may be empty). The output should be a list of courses, grouped by semester, forming a path to graduation.

**Demonstrate the results**

Use your program to run the following experiments:

1. Create a plan for a student who has taken no Computer Science courses. Compare this plan to the Roadmap published by the department.
2. Create a plan for a student who is approximately halfway through the program (i.e. the Fifth Semester shown on the roadmap). Experiment to see what happens to the plan when the student is unable to enroll in all of their classes for the next semester.
3. Create a plan for each undergrad on your team who is not graduating this semester. Can you think of a way to make sure that the plan includes the electives that you would prefer to take?

Analyze and comment on the results of each experiment.

**Platform**

If you use the code from the GitHub repository for the textbook, you may combine both code and documentation into a [Jupydter notebook](https://jupyter.org/#about-notebook). The Jupyter project [recommends](https://jupyter.org/install) [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) if you intend to run notebooks locally on a laptop or desktop computer (e.g. on Tuffix). You may also use a cloud service such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) that offers Jupyter notebooks online.

If you implement your project as a conventional Python program, you should provide the source code and sample input and output files, as well as any other necessary files (for example, data or shell scripts). Your code must run successfully on [Tuffix 2022](https://github.com/kevinwortman/tuffix). You will also need to provide either a plain-text README file or documentation in PDF format describing how to use your program.

**Documenting your results**

Document your program, your input and output formats, and any other ancillary material such as programs or scripts in a report in PDF format.

At the beginning of your report, include the following:

- The names of each member of the team who participated in the project
- The course number, section, and semester
- The project number

For each step:

- Identify what is to be done.
- Document the tools to be used.
- Describe your results, including definitions, diagrams, screenshots, or code as appropriate.
- Comment on the results, including references you consulted, variations you considered, or issues you encountered.

**Submission**

Submit your work as a .ipynb file or a [tarball](https://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/FAQ/whats-tarball-or-how-do-i-unpack-or-create-tgz-or-targz-file) (.tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.Z, .tar.bz2, or .tar.xz) file through Canvas by the due date. Only one submission is required for a team.

**Grading**

The project will be evaluated on the following five-point scale, inspired by the [general rubric](https://cs533.ekstrandom.net/f21/assignments/#general-rubric) used by Professor Michael Ekstrand at Boise State University:

**Exemplary (5 points)**

The project is a success. All requirements met. The quality of the work is high.

**Basically Correct (4 points)**

The project is an overall success, but some requirements are not met completely, or the quality of the work is inconsistent.

**Solid Start (3 points)**

The project is mostly finished, but some requirements are missing, or the quality of the work does not yet meet professional standards.

**Serious Issues (2 points)**

The project has fundamental issues in its implementation or quality.

**Did Something (1 point)**

The project was started but has not been completed enough to assess its quality fairly or is on the wrong track.

**Did Nothing (0 points)**

The project was not submitted, contained work belonging to someone else, or was of such low quality that there is nothing to assess.
